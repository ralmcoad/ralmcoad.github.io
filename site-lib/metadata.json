Let and be the minimum and maximum value of a point across all dimensions ( and resp.). The mapping is given as follows\nThis transformation partitions the data based on the dimension which has the largest or smallest value. The single dimension values can be then indexed using a B+-Tree index and hence the iMinMax index can be used on top of existing DBMS\nThe range query needs to be transformed. The transformation involves generating a range query on each dimension. The intersection of all range query answers is a superset of the required solution set. This is supposedly still efficient because The produced candidate set cannot be further pruned without losing out critical candidates\nThe search space is reduced and some range subqueries can be pruned without being evaluated By varying , you end up constructing different families of iMinMax index structures.

It's important to note that these observations are made for hypercube queries and uniform data distributions. Queries which touch the boundary of the data space or very skewed queries are handled less efficiently. This technique maps the given -dimensional data space into a -dimensional data space so we can use B-Tree indexing.

data model can be realized in a system with the complete function and high performance required for everyday production use. This paper describes the three principal phases of the System R project and discusses some of the lessons learned from System R about the design of relational systems and database systems in general.\n<br>My notes are from the version of the paper annotated by Prof. Joe Hellerstein (<a data-href=\"Abbreviations#JH\" href=\"abbreviations.html#JH\" class=\"original-internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\" style=\"display: none;\">Abbreviations &gt; JH</a><a data-href=\"Abbreviations#JH\" href=\"abbreviations.html#JH\" class=\"internal-link mathLink-internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">JH</a>) from UC Berkeley. I list some annotation verbatim in my notes (as footnotes).Developed by IBM Research Laboratory, San Jose, California between 1974-1979Prior to the Codd model, conventional database systems stores data in two ways\nBy contents of records\nBy connections between the records Aside\nNavigational System This older models are called navigational systems where for every query, the burden is on the user to specify the query's algorithm (through the access paths the query must use)\nAny changes made to the representation of data would require changes being made to the application code\nThe navigational system is a problem since, in the words of Joe Hellerstein\ni.e. the rate of change of the environment (disks etc) is much faster than the rate of change of an application built on top of a database systems. In navigational systems where queries are dependent on the physical layout, application code will have to change with the database. The relational database system as modeled by Codd have two important properties\nAll information shown to the user is represented as data values and not dependent as connections\nA high-level query language which supports data queries without specifying the algorithm\nAt that point it was doubtful is an automatic system could be as good as an experienced programmer in picking an efficient algorithm for processing queries The key goals were\n<br>Provide a high-level non-navigational user interface for <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Data Independence Principle\" data-href=\"Data Independence Principle\" href=\"glossary/data-independence-principle.html\" class=\"original-internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\" style=\"display: none;\">data independence</a><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Data Independence Principle\" data-href=\"Data Independence Principle\" href=\"glossary/data-independence-principle.html\" class=\"internal-link mathLink-internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">data independence</a>\nSupport different kinds of use cases - transactions, ad hoc queries, report generation\nSupport rapidly changing database environments without having to modify application code\nSupport safe concurrent usage\nSupport recovery\nSupport views and restricted access\nSupport all the above with good performance\nThe history of System R is divided into three phasesOccurred during 1974 and most of 1975Developed the SQL user interface and quick prototyping of a subset of SQL for a single-user environment<br>How cool!

These hidden costs add up making TID-list manipulation especially when they're managed in the database (and not in-memory)\n<br>Rather than the objective being \"minimize number of fetched tuples\", we should aim to minimize the number of I/Os.

Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones","icon":"","description":"\nChanges that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you’re willing to stick with them for years\nMaking a choice that is 1 percent better that seems insignificant in the moment, but over the span of moments make up a lifetime. These choices determine the difference between who you are and who you could be. The three layers of behavior change are - changing outcomes (outermost), changing process (middle) and changing identify (innermost)Focus on changing identity, if you want to get healthy, who you want to be is a healthy person. Do what healthy people do. Make it a part of your identity and your pride will have you make compounding good decisions. As a side note, if you’re strict with identity it’ll make it harder to change. Progress requires unlearning. (For work!)Every action you take is a vote for the person you want to become. Your aim should now be to put yourself in a trajectory towards who you want to become.Homework:\nWho do you want to be? What do I want to stand for? What are my principles and values? Who is the type of person who could get the outcome I want?Habits will make you believe in yourself.The process of building a habit it divided into four steps:\nCue - triggers your brain to initiate a habit\nCraving - motivational force behind every habit\nResponse - the actual habit you perform\nReward - end goal of a habit\nThese four steps are looped to create the habit loop\nIf a behavior is insufficient in any of the four stages, it will not become a habit. This gives you a framework for unlearning and the inverse for learning\nIf you eliminate the cue, the habit will never start\nIf you reduce the craving, you won’t be motivated to perform the habit\nIf the response behavior is difficult to perform, you won’t be able to do it and\nIf the reward fails to satisfy you, you’ll not want to do it again in the future\nThe Four Laws of Behavior ChangeInvert the laws to break a bad habit1st Law (Cue) - Make it obvious (invisible)\n2nd Law (Craving) - Make it attractive (unattractive)\n3rd Law (Response) - Make it easy (difficult)\n4th Law (Reward) - Make it satisfying (unsatisfying)The hard part is going to be altering your these laws to my specificationsThe 1st Law (Make it Obvious)Create a habit scorecard. Write down all your minor habits. Write a “+” if its a good habit, a “-” if it’s a bad habit and “=” if it’s neutral. Maybe create a habit card every 4 weeks?Create implementation intentions:\nWhen situation X arises, I will perform response Y\nIt’s good to start habits at the beginning of the week, month or yearIt’s easy to get derailed or make exception for small things during the day when your goals and habits are vague. <a data-href=\"The Diderot Effect\" href=\"glossary/the-diderot-effect.html\" class=\"original-internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\" style=\"display: none;\">The Diderot Effect</a><a data-href=\"The Diderot Effect\" href=\"glossary/the-diderot-effect.html\" class=\"internal-link mathLink-internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">The Diderot Effect</a>You often decide on what to do next based on what you have just finished doingUtiliza Habit Stacking\nAfter [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT]\nYou need to pick very specific cues to trigger a habit you’re planning on cultivating.Most common cues are time and location. Motivation is Overrated; Environment Often Matters MoreIn 1936, Kurt Lewin wrote: Behavior is a function of the Person in their Environment\nYou should have a lot of visual cues to trigger good behavior. A stable environment where everything has a place and a purpose is an environment where habits can easily form. For instance, use this desk ONLY to do work. Use the couch to read or relax. Use the bed to relax and sleep. People with supposed self-control aren’t different from those that are afflicted with addictions, they are just better at structuring their lives to avoid tempting situations. It’s easier to practice self-restraint when you don’t have to use it very often. Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one. The secret to self-control is to make the cues of good habits obvious and the cues of your bad habits invisible. Apparently it’s nearly impossible to erase a bad habit. In the long term, it’s likely you’ll have to keep resisting temptation. The best strategy is to eliminate cues. If you’re addicted to your phone, throw the phone in a different room when dating. The 2nd Law: Make it AttractiveAt some point, salt, sugar and fat were far and few between. Then, it was logical to eat as much as you could find for survival. However, now in a calorie dense world, we’re still programmed the same and hence why we crave junk food. The Dopamine-Driven Feedback LoopHabits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. Dopamine is released not only when you experience pleasure, but also when you anticipate pleasure. Most actions are taken because of the anticipation that precedes it. More dopamine is released in anticipation than when rewarded. You don’t actually truly enjoy the food you order in, but you always anticipate it. That’s why you’re always left disappointed. Use Temptation Bundling\nAfter [CURRENT HABIT], I will [HABIT I NEED] habit stacking<br>\nAfter [HABIT I NEED], I will [HABIT I WANT] temptation bundling\nSupernormal stimuli - heightened versions of reality that increase our desire to take action.Whatever habits are normal in your culture are among the most attractive behaviors you’ll find!The best is the enemy of the good. It is easy to get bogged down trying to find the optimal plan for change. We are so focused on figuring out the best approach that we never get around to taking action. The biggest reason you slip into motion rather than taking action: delay failure. Motion makes you feel like you’re getting things done but really you’re just preparing to get something done. You just need to get your reps in. Active practice vs passive learningthe Law of Least Effort: when deciding between two similar options, people naturally gravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of work.Habits are the cab, not the gym. When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do so. The point is to master the habit of showing up.

spend a great deal of time reading research papers. However, this skill is rarely taught, leading to much wasted effort. This article outlines a practical and efficient three-pass method for reading research papers. I also describe how to use this method to do a literature survey. Three-pass method for reading research papers The First Pass Quick scan to get bird's eye view of paper\nShould take upto 5-10 mins\nConsists of the following steps Carefully read title, abstract and introduction (and related work if writing a survey)\nRead section and sub-section headings only\nSkim math to see if you have the theoretical foundations\nRead conclusion\nSkim references to take stock of which ones you've read After first pass you should be able to answer the five Cs Category - type of paper\nContext - related papers\nCorrectness\nContributions\nClarity If a reviewer cannot understand your paper after the first pass, it is likely to be rejected; advocates graphical abstracts (summarize paper with a single figure) The Second Pass Read paper ignoring details like proofs\nShould take upto an hour (for an exp. reader)\nJot down key points\nNote down terms you don't understand\nNote down questions you might want to ask the author\nIf you're reviewing, pay special attention to the figures, diagrams, illustrations and plots Make sure conclusions are drawn from statistically significant plots Mark unread references for future reading The Third Pass Attempt to virtually re-implement the paper\nCan take many hours for a beginner and 2 or more for an exp. reader\nBy re-creating the work you may better understand where the work fails and if invalid (or implicit) assumptions were made\nChallenge every assumption in every statement\nJot down ideas for future work\nYou should be able to reconstruct the entire paper from memory and identify weak and strong points\nYou should also be able to point out missing citations and issues with experimental and analytical content Literature Survey Use GoogleScholar and some key words to find 5 recent highly-cited papers\nDo the first pass over these papers and the related work section\nIf a survey exists, read the survey\nElse, find shared citations and repeated authors. Track down important conferences and journals\nGo through these venues to find high quality related work\nMake two passes through these papers, generating the first version of your survey\nIdentify unread key papers from set and iterate as necessary <br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20231226173413.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20231226173413.png\" target=\"_self\">\nSource: From PaperResources\n<br>\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"roscoe2007writing\" data-href=\"roscoe2007writing\" href=\"roscoe2007writing\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Writing reviews for systems conferences</a> <br>\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"http://www.cs.columbia.edu/%E2%88%BChgs/etc/writing-style.html\" rel=\"noopener\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"http://www.cs.columbia.edu/%E2%88%BChgs/etc/writing-style.html\" target=\"_self\">H.

Currently, customers with high rates of mission-critical transactions have split their data into two separate systems, one database for OLTP and one so-called data warehouse for OLAP. While allowing for decent transaction rates, this separation has many disadvantages including data freshness issues due to the delay caused by only periodically initiating the Extract Transform Load-data staging and excessive resource consumption due to maintaining two separate information systems. We present an efficient hybrid system, called HyPer, that can handle both OLTP and OLAP simultaneously by using hardware-assisted replication mechanisms to maintain consistent snapshots of the transactional data. HyPer is a main-memory database system that guarantees the ACID properties of OLTP transactions and executes OLAP query sessions (multiple queries) on the same, arbitrarily current and consistent snapshot. The utilization of the processor-inherent support for virtual memory management (address transalation, caching, copy on update) yields both at the same time: unprecedented high transaction rates as high as several 100000 per second and ultra-low OLAP query response times of as low as 10 ms  all on a commodity desktop server. Even the creation of a fresh, transaction-consistent snapshot can be achieved in 10 ms.\nOLTP\nOnline transaction processing\ntransactions access and process only a small portion of the entire data\nOLAP\nOnline Analytical Processing\nBrought about from BI-applications (Business Intelligence)\nProcess substantial portions of the data to generate reports for BI\nInitial approaches to perform OLAP on OLTP databases were dismissed since OLAP query processing led to resource contentions hurting transaction processingA separate Data Warehouse system is installed for BI. Periodically, OLTP database changes are Extracted, Transformed and Loaded (ETL) into the data warehouse. <br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20240202140825.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20240202140825.png\" target=\"_self\">This approach has several drawbacks:\nstale data - ETL is only executed periodically\nredundancy - cost of maintaining redundant copies of two systems. However, two systems enables customized models for execution - normalized tables for OLTP and star-schema for OLAP\nhigh investments - maintaining two systems has economic penalty (hardware, software...)\nStrong arguments for real time business intelligence advocates for removing the separation (from this point, simply dubbed \"the gap\") between OLTP and OLAP systems.Paper argues that the performance improvements needed to bridge the gap can be achieved through main memory database.Paper argues that critical transactional database volume is limited is size. Furthermore, the size of the main memory is expected to grow faster than the largest business customer's requirements.HyPer uses a main-memory architecture for transaction processing using a single-threading (cite:[15]) approach where OLTP transactions are executed sequentially.Hyper Features Main-Memory Architecture for transaction processing\nSingle-threaded processing Obviates the need for locking and latching Dataview: No results to show for list query.","aliases":["Hyper: Hybrid OLTP&OLAP high performance database

chapters since I mostly know the content.\nRules of inference - chain rule and Modus Ponens (or mod pons)\nModus Ponens Given truth of A\nand of A -&gt; B\ndeduce B Chain Rule Given truth of A -&gt; B\nand of B -&gt; C\ndeduce A -&gt; C\nCopy (it is true that) () (it is universally true that) () - for tautologies The problem of proofs is to prove a formula given the truth of formulae to There are two ways of proving\nGenerate a long truth table for each boolean variable - impractical\nWrite down premises and use rules of inference to deduce other true formulae\nThree different proof strategies\nProof by adopting a premise - to prove an implication of form , assume is true by adopting as a premise and prove . This is equivalent to Reductio Ad Absurdum (reduce to an absurdity) - When applying a chains of inference to a premise, it is possible to get sidetracked and prove irrelevant statements. This is called forward chaining. Instead, you can alternatively try proving the contrapositive () called backward chaining. You can also use both, i.e. assume both and are true i.e. both forward and backward chaining until you reach a contradiction.\nProof by Resolution - Proof by Resolution 1. Convert the Reductio Ad Absurdum premise to Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF)\n2. Take two clauses which contain the same atom with opposite signs and apply resolution to combine the two clauses and eliminate the atom\n3. Continue till you get the conjunction of the same atom with different signs\nCopyLet's try an exercise\nSTEP 1\nConverting the premise\nConverting conclusion to normal formSTEP 2\nSo far we have\nThe statement can be reduced by resolution STEP 3\nWe end up with which is a contradiction ()Advantages of the resolution method are\nDo not have to use equivalences to rearrange atoms as all clauses are in normal form and resolution rule doesn't care about the position\nOnly one rule to remember\nEasy to mechanize\nHowever, it is possible to go round in circles and the normal form makes all the clauses look alike(?)\nA usual rule of thumb is that the existential quantifier () goes with conjunction and the universal quantifier () goes with implication\nA unary predicate (taking only one argument) is true for a subset of the universe of discourse (). This subset is called the extension of the predicate and the predicate is called the Characteristic Function of the subset\nTo negate a quantified expression, change the quantifier, change the signs and change the operators\nPredicate calculus can be used to form queries about stored data i.e. we want the extension of the predicate. Predicates are also used to \"encode\" integrity constraints\nYou can convert quantified expressions to Conjunctive Normal Form as well (CNF) Remove equivalences ( =&gt; )\nRemove implications ( =&gt; )\nMove negation signs from outside to in front of the atoms using De Morgan's laws\nRemove existential quantifiers using Skolemisation - If a variable x is existentially quantified and not nested below a universal quantifier, every occurrence of x is replaced by an unknown Skolem Constant (say ) denoting one value of x for which the statement is true. If is nested under a universal quantifier (), you replace all instances of with a Skolem Function Pull out universal quantifiers\nMultiply out bracketed conjunctions - You can use this CNF form to again use the Resolution method from the first chapter. However, there are some formulae that are \"undecidable\" and can trick computers to go in circles\nWhen using resolution, you can use an answer clause along with the conclusion to keep track of the solution To avoid circles, we provide computer programs with heuristics Unit Preference - It is best to use at least one unit clause in resolution\nSet of support - You must use specific facts from the problem not just general axioms\nChoose unique literals - Attempt to resolve with literals that appear less frequently and appears in the conclusion\nPlanning - A human will usually plan out the proof first, providing meta-information about which axioms are important to drive the proof In the resolution method, the process of finding a substitution which makes two literals clash is called Unification One class of database languages is based on predicate calculus (SQL), others are based on 'Applicative' or 'Functional' languages\nPartial functions - Functions not defined over their whole domain\nRestriction and Union of functions G(x) = if P(x) then F1(x) else F2(x) Translates to G = (F1 restrict P) union (F2 restrict not P) Where (F1 restrict P) translates to function P defined on the intersection between the domain of F1 and the extension of P\nCopy\nWhen evaluating restrictions, the extension of the predicate is evaluated first since can be a partial function\nIn Lambda Calculus, Constructor of new functions is done using the greek symbol and the process is called function abstraction A lambda expression denotes an unnamed function\nIn the functional model, iteration is done using recursion\nfac = lambda n. if n = 0 then 1 else n * fac(n - 1)*\nCopy\nThere are two version of recursion Down-going - Breaks the problem down into smaller problems where the result of the smaller problem is needed to build the answer from the answer from the smaller problems\n<br>Up-going - Intermediate results are computed and passed down to the smaller subproblems using a workspace parameter where the final answer is built and is simply passed back through the call chain (for instance, you can do tail-call elimination maybe from <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"ierusalimschy2006programming\" data-href=\"ierusalimschy2006programming\" href=\"literature-notes/ierusalimschy2006programming.html\" class=\"original-internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\" style=\"display: none;\">Programming in Lua</a><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"ierusalimschy2006programming\" data-href=\"ierusalimschy2006programming\" href=\"literature-notes/ierusalimschy2006programming.html\" class=\"internal-link mathLink-internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Programming in Lua</a>) A list is a sequence of items that are accessed sequentially. There are two functions used to access lists car(list): list -&gt; element - returns the first element of the list\ncdr(list): list -&gt; list - returns a list of all but the first element of the list car([2, 3, 4]) = 2\ncdr([2, 3, 4]) = [3, 4]\ncar(cdr([2, 3, 4])) = 3 -- suppose you want to get the nth element of the list\nselect(n, l) = lambda n,l. if n = 1 then car(s) else select(n-1, cdr(s))\nCopy\nYou can represent trees using nested lists - used for indices like B-Trees\nTo construct a list you can use the cons(&lt;element&gt;, &lt;list&gt;) function which prepends element to the list\ncons(paste, [jam, butter]) = [paste, jam, butter]\nCopy\nThe abstract Lists concept is usually implemented using a linked representation, with a pointer to a list node containing the first item, which has a pointer pointing to the next node and so on\nIt's possible to prepend a list with more than one item using the cons function. Therefore, it's important to copy the original list before cons if you want to create two different lists\nThere are two versions of recursion - down-going and up-going\n--- function to copy list\n-- down-going\ndcopy = lambda s. if s = [] then [] else cons(car(s), dcopy(cdr(s)))\ndcopy([2, 5, 7]) = [2, 5, 7]\n-- up-going\nucopy = lambda s. ucop(s, [])\nucop = lambda s,w. if s = [] then w else ucop(cdr(s), cons(car(s), w))\nucopy([2, 5, 7]) = [7, 5, 2]\n--- intuitively, the down-going version has access to the last element before it constructs the final list which is not the case with the up-going version\nCopy\nPredicate atom(l) returns true if l is atomic i.e. not a list or the empty list [] and false otherwise ex. atom(2) = atom([]) = true; atom([2]) = false\nThe book goes on to discuss how down-going recursion might be slower to execute because of all the space occupied on the stack. In fact, up-going recursion functions can be compiled into iteration + assignment programs ==&gt; removing tail recursion\n-- Other list and set processing operators\nmember(x, s) -&gt; checks if x is in s or is a subset of s\nA orelse B -&gt; if A then true else B\nA andif B -&gt; if not A then false else B\nintsec(la, lb) -&gt; intersection\nsubset(la, lb)\nequal(la, lb)\nCopy<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Literature Notes/ierusalimschy2006programming.md\" data-href=\"Literature Notes/ierusalimschy2006programming.md\" href=\"literature-notes/ierusalimschy2006programming.html\" class=\"original-internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\" style=\"display: none;\">ierusalimschy2006programming</a><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Literature Notes/ierusalimschy2006programming.md\" data-href=\"Literature Notes/ierusalimschy2006programming.md\" href=\"literature-notes/ierusalimschy2006programming.html\" class=\"mathLink-internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\" style=\"\">ierusalimschy2006programming</a>: Programming in lua","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#reading"],"headers":[{"heading":"Logic, algebra and databases","level":1,"id":"Logic, algebra and databases"},{"heading":"1 Propositional Logic","level":2,"id":"1_Propositional_Logic"},{"heading":"2 Predicate Calculus","level":2,"id":"2_Predicate_Calculus"},{"heading":"3 Lambda Expressions and List Processing","level":2,"id":"3_Lambda_Expressions_and_List_Processing"},{"heading":"4 Representing Programs by Clauses: Prolog","level":2,"id":"4_Representing_Programs_by_Clauses_Prolog"},{"heading":"References","level":2,"id":"References"}],"links":["?query=tag:reading","literature-notes/ierusalimschy2006programming.html","literature-notes/ierusalimschy2006programming.html","literature-notes/ierusalimschy2006programming.html","literature-notes/ierusalimschy2006programming.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"literature-notes/gray1984logic.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1702242277886,"modifiedTime":1704281115811,"sourceSize":10249,"sourcePath":"Literature Notes/gray1984logic.md","exportPath":"literature-notes/gray1984logic.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":["literature-notes/literature-notes.html"],"type":"markdown"},"literature-notes/arpacidusseau2018operating.html":{"title":"Operating systems: Three easy pieces","icon":"","description":"Remzi H.

A system call is initiated through a trap, control is passed to a trap handler entering the kernel mode. When the request has been serviced, control is passed back to the user via a return-from-trap instruction Shift from mainframe to minicomputers\nIntroduction of multiprogramming - instead of running one job at a time, run multiple jobs switching rapidly between them.

development of large-scale software systems. Following Brooks we distinguish accidental from essential difficulty, but disagree with his premise that most complexity remaining in contemporary systems is essential. We identify common causes of complexity and discuss general approaches which can be taken to eliminate them where they are accidental in nature. To make things more concrete we then give an outline for a potential complexity-minimizing approach based on functional programming and Codd’s relational model of data.\nPaper discusses common causes of large-scale system complexity (in understanding a system) and ways to avoid accidental complexityThe major contributor to the complexity in the development and maintenance of large-scale software systems is handling of the state. Other factors include code volume and flow of control through the systemThe State problem is usually handled either using object-oriented programming (which couples state with behavior) or functional programming (does away with state and side effects)<br>Paper proposes combining both approaches along with ideas from <a data-href=\"Relational Model\" href=\"glossary/relational-model.html\" class=\"original-internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\" style=\"display: none;\">Relational Model</a><a data-href=\"Relational Model\" href=\"glossary/relational-model.html\" class=\"internal-link mathLink-internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Relational Model</a>While there are other factors that making building large-scale systems hard, the paper reasons that complexity is the root cause of all since understanding the system can fix most other problems but complexity makes understanding hard\nSimplicity is Hard\nTwo approaches to understanding systems\nTesting Treat system as a blackbox and draw conclusions based on system's response to certain situations\nTests on one input tells you nothing about the system's behavior on another input Informal Reasoning Understand system by examining the internals The latter is considered more important since it can lead to generating less errors whereas the former can only detect more errors\nHave you ever performed the right tests? Negative.\nCauses of Complexity - sometimes complexity is inherent in the problem, sometimes not\nComplexity caused by State (a stateful system) \"try it again\", \"reload the document\" ... the presence of state makes programs hard to understand\nSpecifically, it is the number of possible states that makes it complex - The number of states grow exponentially; with each extra bit the number of states doubles State on Testing tests on one state tell you nothing about other states\nA common approach is to assume a clean initial state when testing - can't always get away with this\nThe issues with testing, and the number of states compound State on Informal Reasoning As the number of states increase, informally reasoning by performing a mental case-by-case simulation gets out of hand\nContamination - Even if a procedure is stateless on it's own, if it uses any other procedure that is even indirectly stateful, the procedure is contaminated and is again hard to reason Complexity caused by Control (Order in which things happen) When a programmer is forced (through use of a language with implicit flow control) to specify the control, they are being forced to specify an aspect of how the system should work rather than simply what is desired, effectively over-specifying the problem When an artificial order is imposed, some compilers choose to ignore the order. However, when trying to informally reason through the code, the reader is forced to first assume the order is important, then upon further inspection, determine if it isn't (which is prone to mistakes)\nAnother issue with control occurs with concurrency Concurrency makes it harder to reason when using shared-state concurrency (most common form) where the number of scenarios are too many\nAlso testing is difficult since the system can exhibit different behavior on the same input and same initial state when run multiple times Complexity caused by Code Volume Mostly a side effect - managing state or specifying control\nOf interest because (1) easiest form of complexity to measure and (2) interacts badly with other causes of complexity Complexity exhibits a nonlinear increase with size of code\nDijkstra mused that there's some law of nature that the amount of intellectual effort needed grows with the square with the program length. He later argues that with powers of abstraction, the amount of intellectual effort needed need not grow more than proportional to program length Paper argues that with effective management of state and control, the non-linearity is uncertain Other causes include: duplicated code, dead code, unnecessary abstraction, missed abstraction, poor modularity, poor documentation...\n- Complexity breeds complexity (secondary causes, if you don't understand code, it is likely you'll write duplicate code),\n- Simplicity is Hard (effort is needed, first solution usually not simple) and\n- Power corrupts (the more power that a language gives the programmer, the more wary one should be of the produced code; argues that garbage collection is good) Classical approaches to manage complexity - Object-orientation, Functional Programming and Logic Programming Object-Orientation The dominant (imperative) method for general software development for traditional von-Neumann (state-based) computation\nIn OOP, an object consists of a state with an associated set of methods that manipulate the state - encapsulation enforcing integrity constraints over an object's state\nTwo issues with OOP If multiple methods access the object, a constraint may have to be enforced across all methods\nIt's difficult to enforce constraints based on multiple objects and not just a single one Object Identity - In OOP, each object is a uniquely identifiable entity regardless of its attributes (intensional identity). In contrast, in relational algebra, objects have extensional identity where objects are the same if their attributes are the same Useful when using a mutable stateful abstraction - two distinct stateful objects can be mutated to contain different states even if their attributes happen to initially be the same (???????)\nProblematic otherwise, since now in OOPs we need procedures to check if two objects are equal based on attribute values All forms of OOPs rely on state and hence suffer from all problems associated with state\nMost OOPs language provide standard seq control and shared-state concurrency leading to all the pre-specified problems\nSome OOPs languages provide message-passing models (actor-style), however, not widespread Functional Programming Completely stateless lambda calculus of Church\nUntyped lambda calculus is equivalent in power to the standard stateful abstraction of computation (the Turing machine)\nState Modern functional languages are either pure (no state or side-effects) or impure (discourage state and side-effects but permit use)\nBy avoiding state - referential transparency (when providing a set of arguments, a function will always behave the same way) (testing becomes more effective)\nInformal reasoning is more effective as well Control Functional languages specify a left-to-right sequencing of calculation of function arguments (some implicit order) and hence, can face the same problems as with OOPs however, concurrent variants do exist In the functional style, to simulate implicit mutable states, we instead pass explicit mutable function arguments maintaining referential transparency. However, this approach soon impairs informal reasoning if the state being passed is large and complex, you end up passing irrelevant data. That being said, there are benefits to avoiding hidden, implicit, mutable state. State and Modularity\nStates can permit some forms of modularity. Within a stateful framework, you can add state to any component without adjusting the components that invoke it. In the functional framework, every component has to carry additional information\nThe tradeoff lies in referential transparency\nOne approach is apparently using the system of monads used by Haskell [@wadler1995monads] Logic Programming Declarative, not derived from stateful von-Neumann architecture\nIn pure logic programming, you only make statements about the problem and desired solutions (by specifying axioms which describe the problem and the attributes satisfied by solutions)\nRunning the system is equivalent to \"constructing a valid proof for each solution\"\nState - Pure logical programming (unlike it's extensions) makes no use of mutable state and hence has the same advantages in understandability as pure functional programming\nControl - pure Prolog specifies both an implicit ordering (left to right) and an implicit ordering of clause application (top down). This is not the case in ideal logic programming where there is no such order\nIn theory, logic programming can escape from complexity problems caused by control\nEssential Complexity - Inherent in, and the essence of, the problem (as seen by the users)\nAccidental Complexity - all the rest; complexity with which the development team would not have to deal with in the ideal worldIdeal World\nNot concerned with performance; language and infrastructure provide all general support\nState is accidental state if it can be omitted in the ideal world. Similarly for control\nEven in the ideal work, we need to derive formal requirements(processable by a computer) from informal requirements (from users)\nInformal Requirements -&gt; Formal Requirements\nThe next step is to simply execute formal requirements directly - absolute simplicity and declarative programming\nState in Ideal World\nSome data specified in the users informal requirements can give rise to state\nAll data is either provided directly to the system (input) or derived. Further, derived data is either immutable (only intended for display) or mutable (explicitly asked to update data) Input data - included in the informal requirements and falls into one of two cases A possibility the system may need to refer to the data in the future - essential state\nNo possibility - data need not be maintained, no state generated Essential Derived Data - Immutable Can always be re-derived from input (essential state) -&gt; Accidental State Essential Derived Data - Mutable Can be re-derived (accidental state)\nMutability only makes sense when the mutating function has an inverse - otherwise it is not considered as derived data and is effectively input Accidental Derived Data State that is derived but not in requirements is accidental state <br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20240105205838.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20240105205838.png\" target=\"_self\">Control in the ideal world\nControl is considered entirely accidental How close is it possible to get to the ideal world in the real one?\nTheoretical and Practical Limitations\nFormal specifications are categorized into two categories Property-based - focus on what is required (declarative)\nModel-based - Construct a potential model for the system (stateful) There are two reasons why we might be forced to include some accidental state Ease of expression - sometimes it's more natural to store some accidental (mutable derivable state) instead of deriving the state from the input using logic (the position of a player in a game)\nPerformance - Using accidental state and control can improve efficiency It's important to keep in mind, that once we introduce accidental state, however required it may be, we expose ourselves to the same problems that were discussed before\nRecommendations for dealing with required accidental complexity - Avoid and Separate<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20240108115831.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20240108115831.png\" target=\"_self\">\nPaper advocates a high level separation into three components each specified by a different restricted language - Essential State, Essential Logic, Accidental State and Control\nAccidental State and Control are only there to improve performance; therefore, the system should work without this component, albeit slowly\n<br>Discusses <a data-href=\"Relational Model\" href=\"glossary/relational-model.html\" class=\"original-internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\" style=\"display: none;\">Relational Model</a><a data-href=\"Relational Model\" href=\"glossary/relational-model.html\" class=\"internal-link mathLink-internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Relational Model</a><br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Glossary/Relational Model.md\" data-href=\"Glossary/Relational Model.md\" href=\"glossary/relational-model.html\" class=\"original-internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\" style=\"display: none;\">Relational Model</a><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Glossary/Relational Model.md\" data-href=\"Glossary/Relational Model.md\" href=\"glossary/relational-model.html\" class=\"mathLink-internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\" style=\"\">Relational Model</a>: -","aliases":["Out of the tar pit"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#Ben-Moseley","#Peter-Marks","#reading"],"headers":[{"heading":"Out of the tar pit","level":1,"id":"Out of the tar pit"},{"heading":"References","level":2,"id":"References"}],"links":["?query=tag:Ben-Moseley","?query=tag:Peter-Marks","?query=tag:reading","glossary/relational-model.html","glossary/relational-model.html","glossary/relational-model.html","glossary/relational-model.html","glossary/relational-model.html","glossary/relational-model.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"literature-notes/moseley2006out.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":["images/pasted-image-20240105205838.png","images/pasted-image-20240108115831.png"],"createdTime":1704289073143,"modifiedTime":1727266855274,"sourceSize":12817,"sourcePath":"Literature Notes/moseley2006out.md","exportPath":"literature-notes/moseley2006out.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":["glossary/relational-model.html","literature-notes/literature-notes.html","til/til-words.html"],"type":"markdown"},"literature-notes/ierusalimschy2006programming.html":{"title":"Programming in lua","icon":"","description":"Roberto Ierusalimschy (2006)Tags: <a href=\".?query=tag:paused\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"#paused\">#paused</a>Abstract\nTables are the only data structures in Lua. Even a function from a library like math.sin actually translates to \"index table named math using string sin as key\"\nTables are not values or variables, they are objects.

Typically, C is used for better performance and to access facilities not easily accessible directly from Lua, like OS facilities\nAll function arguments are optional, nils are tail-padded\nfunction incCount (n) n = n or 1 -- If n is nil, set n to 1, default globalCounter = globalCounter + n\nend\nCopy\nLua functions can return multiple values which can be destructed using multiple assignments, arguments to function calls, table constructors or return statements. function foo() return a, b, c\nend x, y = foo() -- x = a, y = b\nx, y, z, w = foo() -- x, y, z, w = nil\nx, y = foo(), 20 -- x = a, y = 20 -- when function is last or only call to another function, all results are passed print(x, foo()) --&gt; x a b c\nprint(foo(), x) --&gt; a x -- table constructor collects all results t = {foo()} --&gt; {a, b, c} -- return also returns all results return foo() --&gt; a, b, c -- you can force use of one single argument by using parentheses print((foo())) --&gt; a\nCopy\nLua functions can be variadic i.e. take a variable number of arguments like print in C using the varag expression (...)\n--- three dots '...'

A tail call is a goto dressed as a call. It happens when a function calls another as its last action and has nothing else to do after\nfunction f (x) x = x + 1; return g(x) -- tail call, without return it isn't a tail call since f has to discard g results\nend --[[\nThe program does not need to keep any information about f on the stack once g is called.

neighbor” problem. We show that under a broad set of conditions (much broader than independent and identically distributed dimensions), as dimensionality increases, the distance to the nearest data point approaches the distance to the farthest data point. To provide a practical perspective, we present empirical results on both real and synthetic data sets that demonstrate that this effect can occur for as few as 10–15 dimensions. These results should not be interpreted to mean that high-dimensional indexing is never meaningful; we illustrate this point by identifying some high-dimensional workloads for which this effect does not occur. However, our results do emphasize that the methodology used almost universally in the database literature to evaluate high-dimensional indexing techniques is flawed, and should be modified. In particular, most such techniques proposed in the literature are not evaluated versus simple linear scan, and are evaluated over workloads for which nearest neighbor is not meaningful. Often, even the reported experiments, when analyzed carefully, show that linear scan would outperform the techniques being proposed on the workloads studied in high (10–15) dimensionality! <br><a

You have the following struct:pub struct SaturatingU16 { value: u16,\n}\nCopyAnd you need to write From trait implementations for types: u16, u8, &amp;u16, &amp;u8My first attempt was to do something like this:impl&lt;T&gt; From&lt;T&gt; for SaturatingU16 where T: Into&lt;u16&gt; { fn from(value: T) -&gt; Self { SaturatingU16 { value: value.into() } }\n} impl&lt;T&gt; From&lt;&amp;T&gt; for SaturatingU16 where T: Into&lt;u16&gt; { fn from(value: &amp;T) -&gt; Self { SaturatingU16 { value: (*value).into() } }\n}\nCopyWhere in I create one implementation for owned types and another for reference types.

What about TryFrom for an enum from: String, &amp;String, &amp;str? How do you create a static vector in a function for dynamic programming type things? Implementing Iterator and IntoIterator and related non-consuming versions. Also the less verbose versions using slice? Bog down on the differences between Iter, Iterator, IntoIterator and so on … Given an example collection struct, find out how to idiomatically implement iterators I wanted to generate unique ticketIDs, so I used a static variable but had to use an unsafe block to update the static variable fn new() -&gt; TicketId { static mut COUNTER: u64 = 0; unsafe { COUNTER += 1; return TicketId(COUNTER); }\n}\nCopyOkay, 100 Exercises to Learn Rust is easily becoming one of my favorite Rust courses.
